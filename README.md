# lineRobot
Robot that follows a line and avoid obstacles

This project was built using the TI MSP432 and code composer studio. Several pieces of electroncis were used to design and construct this project.
Among them sensors, stepper motors, and motors were used to rotate the wheels, swerve in the line direction, and avoid the obstacles. One sensor was 
pointed to the ground to recognize the line, and the other in front to detect objects standing in the way.
